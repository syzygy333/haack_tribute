<p>What if someday, entropy's command becomes so great that everything stops? What if energy distributes itself so well that everything is equal everywhere? Would this mean that Spaceship Earth would stop, or maybe land somewhere?</p>

<p>Well, here's the answer: if you love to love, and if you love to move and be, you may decide to go on to something else -- you might just rest your body and use the power of your mind to think and dream and imagine and fly; maybe if all physical things came to a standstill, maybe your thoughts and dreams would still go on forever, to other ships in other universes, until the very entropy of your mind came home again.</p>
